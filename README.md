CASE STUDY 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis. This case study taught me that cleaning data is where real analysis begins—and where curiosity turns into insight.
The task? Analyze scraped Amazon product and review data to deliver actionable insights for sellers.

What I didn’t expect was that this dataset—at first glance, a tidy CSV of 1,465 rows and 16 columns—would tell a story not just of products, but of the messy, human reality behind online reviews.
